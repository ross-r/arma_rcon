This repository contains source code for what would have been an rcon tool for the game ArmA 3.

The goal was to write the backend in C++ and export it as a DLL, exposing various API functions and write the frontend in JavaScript utilizing something like Electron.

The project never saw completion and at the time I was using it as a way to teach my friend C/C++ for his uni course.
